# Storefront release (push = live)

`main` is GitHub-synced to the live theme. A push deploys. Never push partial or unvalidated work.

## Preconditions
- `storefront-preflight` passed: on `main`, clean intent, no active rebase.
- Definition of Done checklist from `storefront-build` passed for every changed section/block.
- Changes are inside `/Users/vMac/06_storefront/shopify_github_synched_theme_files`.

## Validate before commit
From the repo: `npm run validate` and `npm run validate:full` (full Theme Check). Fix all errors. Do relevant visual/critical-flow QA (use chrome-devtools at 320–1440px for customer-facing changes).

## Commit & push (Desktop Commander only)
```
cd /Users/vMac/06_storefront/shopify_github_synched_theme_files
git add -A && git commit -m "<type(scope): summary>" && git push origin main
```
If push is rejected (Shopify reverse-sync added a commit):
```
git pull --rebase origin main && git push origin main
```

## Verify
- Local `HEAD` == `origin/main`.
- Verify live output when observable (edge cache can lag on the bare domain).
- `dev` will be fast-forwarded to `main` automatically by `sync-dev.yml`.

## Never
- `shopify theme push|publish|delete`, any dev server, or `npm run push`/raw deploy. The Bash guard hook blocks these.
- Touch product/order/customer/inventory/checkout/billing data or app-managed `ecom-*`/`ss-*`/`foxify-*` files without explicit approval.

## Report
Files changed, checks run, commit hash, push status, remaining production risk.
