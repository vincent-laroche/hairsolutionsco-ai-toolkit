## Keyword Research Framework

### Keyword Tiers

**Tier 1 — Pillar Keywords** (high volume, high competition)
- Monthly volume: 10,000+
- Goal: Long-term authority building
- Strategy: Pillar pages, comprehensive guides

**Tier 2 — Target Keywords** (medium volume, medium competition)
- Monthly volume: 500–10,000
- Goal: Primary traffic drivers
- Strategy: Service/product pages, blog posts

**Tier 3 — Long-Tail Keywords** (low volume, low competition)
- Monthly volume: 50–500
- Goal: Quick wins, specific buyer intent
- Strategy: FAQ pages, specific articles

### Keyword Research Process
1. Seed keywords from business description + competitor domains
2. Expand using Google Autocomplete + People Also Ask
3. Analyze using Google Keyword Planner, Ubersuggest, or Ahrefs
4. Group by search intent (informational, commercial, transactional)
5. Map keywords to specific pages (one primary keyword per page)
6. Identify gaps — topics competitors rank for but you don't

## On-Page Optimization Template

```markdown
Page: [URL]
Primary Keyword: [keyword] (monthly volume: X)
Secondary Keywords: [keyword1, keyword2]

CURRENT:
Title: [current title]
Meta: [current meta description]
H1: [current H1]
Word Count: [X]

OPTIMIZED:
Title: [keyword] | [Brand Name] [Under 60 chars]
Meta: [compelling description with keyword + CTA, 150-160 chars]
H1: [Primary keyword naturally included]
Content Additions: [list what's missing]
```

## Core Web Vitals Fixes

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Optimize above-fold images (compress, use WebP, add `loading="eager"`)
- Preload hero image with `<link rel="preload">`
- Use CDN (Cloudinary for image delivery)
- Reduce server response time

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Set explicit width/height on all images and videos
- Reserve space for ads and embeds
- Avoid injecting content above existing content

### First Input Delay (FID)
- Minimize JavaScript execution on main thread
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Break up long tasks

## Local SEO (Service Businesses)

- Complete Google Business Profile with photos, hours, services
- NAP consistency (Name, Address, Phone) across all citations
- Encourage and respond to Google reviews
- Local landing pages for each service area
- Local schema markup (LocalBusiness type)
- Citations in relevant directories (Yelp, Yellow Pages, industry-specific)

## Competitor Analysis

For each top-3 competitor:
1. Check domain authority (Moz/Ahrefs)
2. Top organic keywords (Ubersuggest/SEMrush)
3. Backlink sources — identify linkable patterns
4. Content gaps — what do they rank for that you don't?
5. Page structure differences on high-ranking pages

## Reporting Metrics

Track monthly in Google Search Console + Analytics 4:
- Total organic impressions and clicks
- Average position for top 20 keywords
- Click-through rate by page
- Pages gaining/losing impressions
- Core Web Vitals scores
